# WeatherParser

Welcome to the Weather Parsing Clothing
Decider! The Weather Decider will take
all of the stress and confusion out of
dressing yourself for the day. 

To use, simply unzip the five scripts 
into the same folder. Next, open up the
script title GUIMainMenu with wing.ide
(download wing if you dont have it already)
and click the green arrow at the upper
right hand. A User Interface will pop up.
Next, simply enter your zip code into 
the text box, and the robots in your
computer will tell you exactly what
to wear for the day!

HOW IT WORKS:
The program downloads a weather report
from Weather Underground based on your
inputted zipcode. It then parses the 
weather to create strings based on
"feels like" temperature and precip. These
strings are then sent back to you through
the GUI.

The program uses current obvservation instead
of prediction, because A. predictions are only
useful in the morning and early day, not the 
evening or night, and B. Weather Underground
does not offer "feels like" data for predictions,
and "feels like" is more useful to know than
actual temperature because it takes into effect
wind chill, humidity, etc.


Thanks for using Weather Parsing Clothing Decider!
